Hello! My name is Sophia and I love the outdoors and the sunshine. I have 3 younger siblings, two girls and one boy. I have a dog named Finley who is a woodle (wheaten terrior poodle mix). I am from Denver, Colorado which is why I think I love the outdoors so much. My favorite place I have ever been is the Amalfi Coast in Italy, it was a dream come true trip and I hope to make it back there again soon.
